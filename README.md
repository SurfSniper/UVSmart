## Project Overview 
### Problem Statement
Currently the Australian UV levels have increased significantly from 2% to 6% since the 1990s and simultaneously outdoor activities have also increased.  Prolonged sun exposure to strong ultraviolet rays (UV) can lead to skin cancer. Australians are exposed to UV more than any other country in the world. With the increase of international students studying in Victoria, there is a need to raise awareness on how we might protect them against the harmful UV radiation to prevent skin damage.
